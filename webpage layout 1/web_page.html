            Like the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history
            of Gangtok.[6] The earliest records date from the construction of
            the hermitic Gangtok monastery in 1716.[7] Gangtok remained a small
            hamlet until the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 made
            it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of
            Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response
            to a hostage crisis. After the defeat of the Tibetans by the
            British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet
            and British India at the end of the 19th century.[8] Most of the
            roads and the telegraph in the area were built during this time.

            Darjeeling is a city and a municipality in the Indian state of West
            Bengal. It lies in the Lesser Himalayas at an elevation of 2,000
            metres (6,560 ft). It is noted for its tea industry, its scenic
            views of the world's third-highest mountain Kangchenjunga, and the
            Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a narrow-gauge mountain railway which
            is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Darjeeling is the headquarters
            of the Darjeeling district which has a partially autonomous status
            called Gorkhaland Territorial Administration within the state of
            West Bengal. It is also a popular tourist destination in India. In
            the early 19th century during East India Company rule in India a
            sanatorium and a military depot were set up in the region.
            Subsequently, extensive tea plantations were established, the tea
            growers developing hybrids of black tea and creating new
            fermentation techniques. A distinctive Darjeeling tea emerged, which
            became internationally recognised and has ranked among the most
            popular black teas in the world.[6] The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway
            connecting the town with the North Bengal plains was completed in
            1881 and has some of the few remaining steam locomotives in service
            in India. Darjeeling has several British-style private schools that
            attract pupils from India and neighbouring countries. The culture of
            the town reflects its diverse demographic milieu which comprises the
            Lepcha, Khampa, Kirati, Gorkha, Newari, Sherpa, Bhutia, Bengali[7]
            as well as other Indian ethno-linguistic groups. Darjeeling and
            nearby Kalimpong were the centres of the Gorkhaland movement in the
            1980s.

            Gangtok is a city, municipality, the capital and the largest
            populated place of the Indian state of Sikkim. It is also the
            headquarters of the Gangtok District. Gangtok is in the eastern
            Himalayan range, at an elevation of 1,650 m (5,410 ft). The city's
            population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities such as Bhutia,
            Lepchas, Kiratis and Gorkhas. Within the higher peaks of the
            Himalaya and with a year-round mild temperate climate, Gangtok is at
            the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry. Gangtok rose to prominence
            as a popular Buddhist pilgrimage site after the construction of the
            Enchey Monastery in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese Chogyal,
            Thutob Namgyal, transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early
            20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route
            between Lhasa in Tibet and cities such as Kolkata (then Calcutta) in
            British India. After India won its independence from the British
            Empire in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with
            Gangtok as its capital. After Sikkim's merger with India in 1975,
            Gangtok continued as the state capital
